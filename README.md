## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.
Expected Outcomes:
• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries:
• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>Unavaalan</h3>
<ul><li>In India, 86% of farmers are small or marginal (NABARD, 2022). Most rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for critical decisions like crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that consider soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This results in:
- Low crop yields and income instability
- Excessive input costs due to inefficient practices
- Environmental degradation from chemical overuse
- Limited access to modern agri-tech due to language barriers and low digital literacy

Why This Problem Must Be Solved
Empowering small farmers with scientific, localized insights can:
- Boost productivity and reduce input costs
- Improve livelihoods and rural resilience
- Promote sustainable agriculture and reduce environmental harm
- Strengthen national food security
A smart advisory system can democratize access to expert guidance, reduce dependency on unreliable sources, and enable informed decision-making in native languages.
</li>
<li>1. Lack of Scientific Advice → Personalized Crop Guidance
2. Overuse of Chemicals → Smart Fertilizer & Pest Control
3. Low Digital Literacy → Voice & Language Support
4. No Weather Awareness → Real-Time Alerts
5. Market Confusion → Price Tracking
6.. No Feedback Loop → Continuous Improvement
This solution turns a basic phone into a smart farming assistant—giving farmers the power of expert advice, in their own language, right in their pocket. It replaces guesswork with science, and isolation with support.
